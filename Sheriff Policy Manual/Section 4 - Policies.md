# § 4.2 | Identification Regulations
The British Columbia Sheriff Service has subordinate divisions that require secrecy and
discreet operations to further protect their information or individuals involved with the
divisions.
We require standard employees to display their usernames due to the nature of their duties,
primarily involving basic patrol operations and situations. There is no reason to hide your
identity whilst representing the British Columbia Sheriff Service as Field Operations or
marked.
Those in the Special Investigations Division and the Protective Operations Unit can hide
their username for the purpose of their duties but they must give civilians their badge
number and name upon request. If civilians or other peace officers request your badge
number, they are not required to give any reason for your badge number and name.
A British Columbia Sheriff Service employee must provide their username, callsign and rank
if it's requested by said person. If deputies are found failing to provide a badge number and
name, they will be subjected to disciplinary action being taken upon them.

# § 4.3 | Supervisor Regulations
Situations are likely to arise in which an individual should be obligated to request a
supervisor for the purpose of settling a detainment or an arrest. An individual is entitled to
request a supervisor until it is deemed that they have abused the request as a means to
waste the time of law enforcement. We recommend deputies have some sort of evidence to
back up the allegations but supervisors are prohibited from forcing an employee to release
someone.
Abuse in the privileges to request a BC Sheriff supervisor may be determined should it be
shown that the individual has made the request without a legitimate cause, established
reasoning that any reasonable person would know that the matter would not require a
supervisor.
Should a supervisor be requested, a deputy must provide a supervisor as soon as possible,
and if a supervisor fails to respond within five [5] minutes of the initial request, the request
may be denied but individuals must give their badge and name.
