  <b>SHERIFF POLICY MANUAL</b>
</p>

---

# § 3.1 | Chief Sheriff
Under the guidance of the Chief Sheriff, the British Columbia Sheriff Service operates
under the direction of the Chief Sheriff, AlexAero. All department operations, procedures
and guidelines have been set by the Office of the Chief Sheriff in accordance with the
Vancouver Criminal Code and other existing statutes in the City of Vancouver. As previously
stated, the Chief Sheriff assumes the role of the Agency Executive of the British Columbia
Sheriff Service and is overseen by the B.C. Attorney General.

# § 3.2 | Department Organization
The British Columbia Sheriff Service is one of the B.C. provincial law enforcement agencies
and one of the oldest departments in B.C. As the parental agency, the department has
various subordinate bureaus and offices which each hold a unique responsibility and
generally contribute their parts towards the B.C. Sheriff Service:

# § 3.3 | Administrative Offices:
**Office of the Chief Sheriff**
The Office of the Chief Sheriff provides departmental leadership and
overall general operations that are composed of functional units
established by his administration and himself for the use of public
safety. They provide transparency and frequent updates for the BC
Sheriff Service in an effort to keep the department up-to-date.

**Office of the Deputy Chief**
The Office of the Deputy Chief provides departmental leadership and
operational direction of the British Columbia Sheriff Service as
designated by the Chief Sheriff.

# § 3.4 | Department Bureaus:
**Special Operations Bureau**
The Special Operations Bureau is the primary specialised police force
which holds specialised divisions with different responsibilities and
duties. These units are trained on high-risk situations, such as hostage
situations, and are tasked with protecting certain government officials
or investigating BC Sheriff Service personnel or criminals.

**Field Operations Bureau**
The Field Operations Bureau is the primary police service towards the
community as it houses important divisions which are the faces of the
British Columbia Sheriff Service. The functions of each division are
outlined, and information about the primary use of each division is also
available.

# § 3.5 | Department Divisions:
**Special Investigation Division**
The Special Investigations Division is a primary division and the
primary investigative element that conducts internal investigations as
a result of a complaint or criminal tip line. The division is split into two
units.

**Protective Operations Unit**
The Protective Operations Unit is a primary division whose main
responsibility is ensuring the safety of government officials who seem
to be targeted by a group of people or protecting
government-sponsored events.

**Patrol Division**
The Patrol Division is a primary division inside the Field Operations
Bureau, and it provides basic frontline policing for the community.
One of the primary responsibilities of this division is enforcing laws
and the Vancouver Criminal Code, along with interacting with the
community and possibly encouraging the unemployed to give the
department a try. All recruits who have just graduated from the Sheriff
Academy will be automatically assigned to this division.

**Training Division**
The Training Division is a secondary division for those who are under a
supervisory position but classified as a primary division for those who
are supervisory individuals. The division is the primary educator for
newly inducted recruits who have expressed their interest in the
department.

**Internal Affairs**
The Internal Affairs Division is responsible for conducting internal
investigations upon submission of a complaint. It is also responsible for audits and reviews.

# § 3.6 | Department Subdivisions:

**Combat Interdiction Squadron**
The Combat Interdiction Squad is the tactical component that is
responsible for handling high-risk situations pertaining to protective
operations.

# § 3.7 | Order of Succession
The British Columbia Sheriff Service has a designated order of succession in the event that
there is a vacancy within the ranks of Command, High, or Administration. This serves as a
non-bias “promotional” regulation to ensure that all promotions are fair for all personnel
and the limitations of being “biassed”. The Order of Succession and/or order of notification
in the event of an emergency, the chain of command is as follows:
- Chief Sheriff
- Deputy Chief
- Chief Superintendent
- Superintendent: Special Operations Bureau
- Superintendent: Field Operations Bureau
- Staff Inspector: Protective Operations
- Staff Inspector: Internal Affairs

In choosing someone for a promotion, the Deputy Chief and the Chief Sheriff will look at the
Order of Succession, based on who does the most work. It is purely based on conduct &
behaviour that not everyone in that order will receive promotions.

# § 3.8 | Audit Function
The Chief Sheriff and their administrative team have the authority to request and initiate an
audit for a particular division that may be lacking in terms of activity, dedication or poor
conduct displayed by division personnel or incompetent leadership.
The audit function is made up of a group of investigators picked by SID Command to
partake in the audit and they are responsible for investigating matters and ensuring that the
division is operating to the best of its ability.
Audit conclusions usually result in disciplinary action which is usually administered by the
IA Director or SOB Superintendent at the discretion of the Chief Sheriff and his office.
However, these audits may not last more than thirty days without approval from the Office
of the Chief Sheriff.

The Office of the Chief Sheriff may initiate a department-wide audit which will operate the
same way as a general audit would, but it’ll affect everyone who's currently employed in the
department or apply to certain aspects only.

# § 3.9 | Reformation Function
The Chief Sheriff and their administrative team have the authority to initiate a
department-wide reform or division reforms if it’s found reasonable and in accordance with
passed Legislation and departmental policy. Bureaus and divisions allocated within the
British Columbia Sheriff Service are subjected to reformation if an audit reveals that
leadership is acting outside of their designated capacity or fails to uphold their duties.
Bureau reforms must get authorised and approved by the Chief Superintendent and the
Deputy Chief or Chief Sheriff. Whilst divisions' reforms must get authorised and approved
by their designated Superintendent and a member of the Office of the Chief Sheriff or the
Deputy Chief.

The main purpose of the reformation function is to help improve behaviour, department
representation, inactivity or other reasons, and it’s primarily for certain bureaus, divisions or
even the British Columbia Sheriff Service as a whole. Reforms help give the department or
divisions a fresh start by installing new command personnel or introducing major policies or
procedures that the service is based on. These functions can result in the removal of
individual positions or even a department discharge if it’s found necessary to do so, and the
British Columbia Sheriff's Service will benefit from it.
